# GestureGenius Fixes

This document outlines the fixes implemented to address the issues with the GestureGenius application.

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Self-Testing Mode Problems

#### Camera Screen Refreshing Issue
**Problem:** The camera screen was refreshing constantly, making it difficult to analyze signs.

**Solution:**
- Modified the `generate_frames()` function in `ser.py` to reduce frame processing frequency
- Implemented frame skipping to process only every 3rd frame
- Added frame caching to reuse the last processed frame
- This reduces flickering and provides a more stable video feed

#### Accuracy Display Issue
**Problem:** The model was not showing accuracy consistently.

**Solution:**
- Added a confidence threshold (0.5) to only update predictions with good confidence
- Improved the display of confidence values in the video feed
- Enhanced the UI to clearly show confidence percentages

### 2. Video Call Feature Not Working

**Problem:** The video call feature, which is the major USP of the product, was not working.

**Solution:**
- Added Socket.IO server startup to the server scripts
- Updated `start_servers.sh` to start all three required servers:
  1. Main ASL detection server (Python - port 5000)
  2. Self-testing server (Python - port 5001)
  3. Socket.IO signaling server (Node.js - port 3001)
- Created a dedicated script `start_socket_server.sh` for starting just the Socket.IO server
- Ensured proper cleanup of all server processes when stopping

## How to Run the Application

1. Use the updated `start_servers.sh` script to start all servers:
   ```bash
   cd server
   chmod +x start_servers.sh
   ./start_servers.sh
   ```

2. In a separate terminal, start the React client:
   ```bash
   cd client
   npm install
   npm start
   ```

3. Access the application at http://localhost:3000

## Additional Notes

- The Socket.IO server is crucial for the video calling feature to work
- Make sure all three servers are running for full functionality
- If you encounter any issues with the video call feature, check the browser console for error messages
- For best ASL detection results, ensure good lighting and position your hand clearly in the frame
